    <p>Our city NYC has many great places to go but also some very unpleasant places.</p>
    <p>Here is a table of some of my favorite places but also a place I don't enjoy in NYC.</p>
    <table border = "1">
        <tr>
            <th>Enjoy</th>
            <th>Don't Enjoy</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Chinatown</td>
            <td>Subway</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Soho</td>

            <p>I enjoy Chinatown because it is a familiar area with many things from my family's tradition and my childhood.</p>
            <p>It is a little bit dirty there but here's a pretty good picture.</p>
            <img src = "img/chinatown.jpg" width = "360" height = "240">
            <p>I also used to work at the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory. Here's a link to their website:</p>

            <p>I enjoy Soho because it's an area my friends and I can hang out.</p>
            <p>It's also a beautiful part of Manhattan. Here's a picture.</p>

            <p>Last but not least is our NYC's infamous subway.</p>
            <p>Here's why I don't enjoy it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rat infested.</li>
                <li>Litter everywhere.</li>
                <li>Ancient and unkept stations.</li>
                <li>Dirty trains.</li>
            </ul>
