    <p>I can teach you the fundamentals of how to read notes on sheet music!</p>

            <p>Here's what you have to know to read notes on sheet music:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which clef it's on.</li>
                <li>What key each note corresponds to on the staff.</li>
                <li>The note value of a note.</li>
                <li>The key signature with sharps or flats.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There is a treble clef which is on the top staff and a bass clef that is on the bottom staff.</p>
            <p>Each note corresponds to a key. The correspondings are different on each clef. Here are some charts to help.</p>

            <br>
            <p>You can refer to these acronyms to help you memorize.</p>

            <p>Every note has its own note value.</p>
            <p>There are whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes. Here is a visual chart.</p>
            <img src = "img/notevalues.png">
            <p>Whole notes get 4 beats. Half notes get 2 beats. Quarter notes get 1 beat. Eight notes get 1/2 a beat. Sixteenth notes get 1/4 a beat.</p>
            <p>These rules are important for when you read time signatures and tempos. For now, we are learning how to read notes.</p>

            <p>Sheet music can also have key signatures that will determine if there is a sharp or flat at each corresponding note.</p>
            <p>Here is a graph to help you recognize these key signatures.</p>
            <img src = "img/signatures.png">
            <p>For example, in a G major piece, you would play F sharp instead of normal F.</p>
